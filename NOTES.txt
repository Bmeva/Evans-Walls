SETTING UP GIT IGNORE FILES
go to gitignore.oo inside the searcbar type django
it would create files and folders for git to ignore while pushing to git repo
copy the generated codes and create a file in the root drectory and call it.gitignore


SETTING UP MEDIA FILES
go to settings.py and add 
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR /'media'

go to the root folder and create the media folder
go to the urls. py and import these two

from django.conf import settings

then concatenate this at the last square bracket 
+ static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

also in the allowed host add * which means it should allow every host
